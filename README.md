# scylec

This is my personal, Markdown-based script and presentation system that I use in my lectures.

## What’s so cool about it?

You write a script (in prose) as well as the slides in a single Markdown file. (Support for multiple files coming soon.) scylec then generates HTML that you can view in your browser. The HTML can be printed (neat example printing stylesheet included) with the slides included at the right position, or you can start the presentation mode which shows only the slides. (You can print from presentation mode as well, one slide per page.)

## What’s not so cool about it?

This is a really early release, there are lots of sharp edges. It’s far from being as configurable as I want it to be, but it works for my use case. If yours is different, you may have to adapt it.

## How do I install or use it?

That’s currently still a bit undocumented. Have a look at [Betriebssysteme und Netze](https://github.com/scy/bn), my current scylec-based lecture. Basically, you need a gulpfile, a template and some symlinks.

## What’s the license?

Currently, I have not yet chosen any. Consider it proprietary for the time being.
